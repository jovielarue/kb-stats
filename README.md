# kb-stats

kb-stats is a project that will provide typing statistics to its user. For example, it will provide statistics of your word usage (which words you use most often, how often you misspell a word, etc.) and typing speed (e.g. 123WPM). As kb-stats interfaces directly with the kernel, this is definitely unsafe software. Do not run this software on anyone's computer except for your own. This is **not to be used in any malicious way. This project is simply for my amusement on _my personal computer._ Any use of this code in a malicious manner is absolutely prohibited.**

kb-stats is based off of [evtest's source code](https://github.com/freedesktop-unofficial-mirror/evtest), which is available under the GPL. From the evtest README:

> evtest is a tool to print evdev kernel events. It reads directly from the kernel device and prints a device description and the events with the value and the symbolic name.

> For more information, see the evtest(1) man page.
